# Concision

Scala

* encourages programmers to express themselves **cleanly and concisely**
  with very little boilerplate.

* successfully blends multiple programming-language paradigms (**functional**, **object-oriented**),
  enabling whichever style best models a particular problem or domain.

* combines **flexible syntax** with extraordinary **type safety**, enabling construction of "dialects" that function as domain-specific languages.
