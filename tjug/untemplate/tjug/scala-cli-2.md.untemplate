# scala-cli

* supports **Java** code _as well and easily_ as **Scala** code!

  - On the Java side, `jbang` is the closest competition, but `scala-cli` is in some respects easier to use, more
    "batteries included"
  - and of course, `scala-cli` supports Scala too

* Consider prototyping your Java projects with `scala-cli`

  - maybe mix in a bit of Scala!
