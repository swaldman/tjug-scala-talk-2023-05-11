# Simplicity

[Li Haoyi](https://www.lihaoyi.com/) writes beautiful libraries that emphasize simplicity.
Some examples I enjoy include

* [os-lib](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/os-lib) for simple file-system and process handling
* [requests-scala](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/requests-scala), a simple blocking HTTP client
* [upickle](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/upickle), simple typesafe JSON processing
* [utest](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/utest), beautifully concise testing
* [cask](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/cask), HTTP services without ceremony

Check out all of his libraries [here](https://github.com/orgs/com-lihaoyi/repositories).

Haoyi is also the author of the [mill](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill) build tool, which like all build tools in Scala
is a Swiss Army knife with which you do much more than build.

Haoyi's book [_Hands-On Scala Programming_](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/53836488)
is a great introduction for programmers interested in getting stuff done fast.
