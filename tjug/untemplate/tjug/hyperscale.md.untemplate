# Hyperscale

The Scala ecosystem includes libraries for building concurrent, resilient, incredibly scalable services
based on transformable "functional effects".

* [ZIO](https://zio.dev/)
* [Cats effects](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) / [FS2](https://fs2.io/)

See also [Tapir](https://tapir.softwaremill.com/en/latest/), an infrastructure agnostic endpont definition library.

_These are libraries are challenging. End up here, but don't start your Scala journey with these tools,
unless you are working with a team to mentor you._
